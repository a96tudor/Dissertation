\section*{Original aims of the project}
Traditional intrusion detection systems behave poorly in the case of large distributed systems. For this reason, there is a current need of new monitoring and analysis tools that reduce both false-positive rates and the cognitive burden on human analysts arises. One of such tools is the CADETS user interface, which presents OS-level provenance data as a graph structure. The original aim of this project was to implement and evaluate a machine learning algorithm that can be efficiently used to filter the nodes of interest from this provenance graph in order to facilitate a more efficient analysis.
\section*{Work completed}
This project has been successful. All success criteria were met and I implemented a number of optional extensions. I implemented and comparatively evaluated four machine learning models in terms of their applicability to the problem I am trying to solve in order to decide which are the most appropriate.  As an extension, I also implemented an automated data processing module that connects to the Neo4J database storing the graph data and represents the nodes in a feature-vector format, which can then be passed as input to the machine learning models. Another extension was implementing a REST API that would facilitate communications between the machine learning models and external entities, such as the CADETS user interface. Together with the machine learning models and the feature extractor, this makes the project presented here an independent and scalable tool that can be efficiently used for filtering graph-structured provenance data.
\section*{Special Difficulties}
None.
